We started with a setup of a list with wrappers, libraries and frameworks.Â  This is how I presented it first in the beginning of 2013, but it does not align with modern OpenCL anymore.

Modern OpenCL is not just for C, but with SPIRV as its building block, it is for all languages. The new "coding" menu is therefore focused on languages from now on. We start with Julia and C++, adding more by request.

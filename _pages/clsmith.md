CLsmith makes use of two existing testing techniques, Random Differential Testing and Equivalence Modulo Inputs (<span class="caps">EMI</span>), applying them in a many-core environment, OpenCL. Its primary feature is the generation of random OpenCL kernels, exercising many features of the language. It also brings a novel idea of applying <span class="caps">EMI</span>, via dead-code injection.

The CLsmith tool managed to find over 50 bugs in numerous OpenCL implementation from vendors such as Intel, <span class="caps">AMD</span> and Nvidia. <a href="https://github.com/ChrisLidbury/CLSmith/">It is available for download here</a>.

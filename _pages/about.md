OpenCL needs work. We can complain, but better is to just fix it.

OpenCL.org is all about OpenCL. Its main goal is to make the language and its ecosphere stronger, by providing useful info and supporting porting-projects.
The site is initiated by StreamComputing, but it's run by the OpenCL community.

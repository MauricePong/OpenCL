<span class="st">The Generic Graphics Library</span> (GEGL) is best known as the backend for image processing software<em> Gimp</em>.

GEGL is a graph based image processing framework that allows users to chain together image processing operations represented by nodes into a graph. It provides operations for loading and storing images, adjusting colors, filtering in different ways, transforming and compositing images.

GEGL-OpenCL is an educational initiative that aims to get more developers to study and use OpenCL in their projects.

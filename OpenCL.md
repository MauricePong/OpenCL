## What is OpenCL?

OpenCL (trademark of Apple Computers Inc.) is an open, royalty-free industry standard that makes much faster computations possible through parallel computing. The standard is controlled by non-profit standards organisation Khronos. By using this technique and graphics cards (GPUs) or extensions of modern processors you can for example convert a video in 20 minutes instead of 2 hours.

## How does it work?

OpenCL is an extension to existing languages. It makes it possible to specify a piece of code that is executed multiple times independently from each other. This code can run on various processors – not only the main one. Also there is an extension for vectors (float2, short4, int8, long16, etc), because modern processors have support for that.

>So for example you need to calculate Sin(x) of a large array of one million numbers. OpenCL detects which devices could compute this for you and gives some statistics of each device. You can pick the best device, or even several devices, and send the data to the device(s). Normally you would loop over the million numbers, but now you say something like: “Get me Sin(x) of each x in array A”. When finished, you take the data back from the device(s) and you are finished.

As the compute-devices can do more in parallel and OpenCL is better in describing independent functions, the total execution time is much lower than conventional methods.

## 5 questions on OpenCL

**Q: Why is it so fast?**
A: Because a lot of extra hands make less work, the hundreds of little processors on a graphics card being the extra hands. But cooperation with the main processor keeps being important to achieve maximum output.

**Q: Does it work on any type of hardware?**
A: As it is an open standard, it can work on any type of hardware that targets parallel execution. This can be a CPU, GPU, DSP or FPGA.

**Q: How does it compare to OpenMP/MPI?**
A: Where OpenMP and MPI try to split loops over threads/servers and is CPU-oriented, OpenCL focuses on getting threads being data-position aware and making use of processor-capabilities. There are several efforts to combine the two worlds.

**Q: Does it replace C or C++?**
A: No, it is an extension which integrates well with C, C++, Python, Java and more.

**Q: How stable/mature is OpenCL?**
A: Currently we have reached version 1.2 and is 3 years old. OpenCL has many predecessors and therefore quite older than 3 years.

# Platforms and tools

# <a name="S-libraries"></a>Libraries

The crucial part of every technology and programming language are libraries. They extend the language, simplify it, add new features, and help you build you applications faster. The same goes for OpenCL. This chapter presents a few selected libraries which at the time seemed popular, useful and reliable.

## Wrappers 

### [OpenCL-CLHPP](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-CLHPP)

OpenCL Host API C++ bindings. 

> For many large applications C++ is the language of choice and so it seems reasonable to define C++ bindings for OpenCL.

> The interface is contained with a single C++ header file cl2.hpp and all definitions are contained within the namespace cl. There is no additional requirement to include cl.h and to use either the C++ or original C bindings; it is enough to simply include cl2.hpp.

> The bindings themselves are lightweight and correspond closely to the underlying C API. Using the C++ bindings introduces no additional execution overhead.

### [Boost.Compute](https://github.com/boostorg/compute/)

Boost.Compute is an official Boost library, added to the Boost C++ Libraries package since 1.61 version. It is a comprehensive wrapper for OpenCL 1.0 - 2.0. It provides STL-like algorithms and various helper features (functions, classes) which make developing in C++/OpenCL environment much faster.

> Boost.Compute is a GPU/parallel-computing library for C++ based on OpenCL.

> The core library is a thin C++ wrapper over the OpenCL API and provides access to compute devices, contexts, command queues and memory buffers.

> On top of the core library is a generic, STL-like interface providing common algorithms (e.g. `transform()`, `accumulate()`, `sort()`) along with common containers (e.g. `vector<T>`, `flat_set<T>`). It also features a number of extensions including parallel-computing algorithms (e.g. `exclusive_scan()`, `scatter()`, `reduce()`) and a number of fancy iterators (e.g. `transform_iterator<>`, `permutation_iterator<>`, `zip_iterator<>`).

### [AMD Aparapi](https://github.com/aparapi/aparapi)

Aparapi enables Java developers to define OpenCL kernels and executed them on GPU and APU devices.

>Aparapi allows Java developers to take advantage of the compute power of GPU and APU devices by executing data parallel code fragments on the GPU rather than being confined to the local CPU. It does this by converting Java bytecode to OpenCL at runtime and executing on the GPU, if for any reason Aparapi can't execute on the GPU it will execute in a Java thread pool.

> We like to think that for the appropriate workload this extends Java's 'Write Once Run Anywhere' to include GPU devices.

## Specialized libraries

### [VexCL](https://github.com/ddemidov/vexcl)

VexCL was developed with scientific computing in mind. It provides custom DSL to simplify using various accelerators for vector arithmetic, reduction, sparse matrix-vector product etc. It has some features of a wrapper library, but not all of them. However, it is possible to define generic C++ algorithms with its DSL and write custom kernels using VexCL. It supports both OpenCL and CUDA.

>VexCL is a vector expression template library for OpenCL/CUDA. It has been created for ease of GPGPU development with C++. VexCL strives to reduce amount of boilerplate code needed to develop GPGPU applications. The library provides convenient and intuitive notation for vector arithmetic, reduction, sparse matrix-vectork products, etc. Multi-device and even multi-platform computations are supported. The source code of the library is distributed under very permissive MIT license.

## The OpenCL Architecture

The crucial part of The OpenCL Specification is the chapter about the OpenCL architecture. It is very important to understand at least its basic principles. Without this knowledge it is not possible neither to efficiently program using OpenCL nor to use it to its full capabilities. 

The architecture is described by four models:

* Platform Model
* Memory Model
* Programming Model
* Execution Model

The platform model describes in general how the OpenCL framework looks like and gives definitions of a host and an OpenCL device. The memory model explains different memory regions and memory objects introduced in OpenCL. More advanced sections about memory model present details of how shared virtual memory mechanism works, and presents memory consistency model and ordering rules. Since OpenCL 2.0 the programming model does not have its own section. It specifies that the OpenCL execution model supports both data parallel and task parallel programming models.

The execution model is the model that explains how the OpenCL framework really works. It defines responsibilities of a host program, it says what is a command queue, what is a kernel, and it describes how an execution of an OpenCL kernel on a device works. In order to understand OpenCL you must carefully read and understand particularly this part of the specification, and know: how workloads are mapped onto devices, when synchronization happens, what is an index space.
